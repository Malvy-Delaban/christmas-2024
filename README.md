# Poke Adventure
Simple Fan Game of a known franchise

This is a private site for myself and close friends.
As it was just a fun little project at first, the project is not documented nor easily useable without context.
Must be used on smartphone, no adaptative CSS has been made.

Everything is locally stored and handled, there is no backend server :
- If you delete local storage, eveything is gone ! Be sure to download your save frequently
- You can cheat anyway you want, have fun !
- No account nor verification is needed

The target being my french speaking girlfriend and close friends, the app is completely french (that includes the monsters names) and no translation is available.
